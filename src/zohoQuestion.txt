How It Works
Understanding the Problem
The application requires handling different ticket categories:

Confirmed Tickets: 63 berths (Lower, Upper, Middle).
RAC Tickets: 9 berths (18 passengers).
Waiting List Tickets: 10 tickets max.
Conditions for Booking:

If the passenger is a senior citizen (>60 years) or a female, a lower berth should be allocated if available.
If all berths are full, assign RAC.
If RAC is full, assign Waiting List.
If Waiting List exceeds 10 passengers, display “No tickets available”.
Conditions for Cancellation:

On canceling a confirmed ticket, an RAC ticket should move to confirmed, and a waiting-list ticket should move to RAC.
Conditions for Printing Tickets:

Booked Tickets: Display all confirmed passengers with details.
Available Tickets: Show available berths, RAC slots, and Waiting List slots.
Solution Structure
The solution involves three classes:

Passenger: Stores passenger details and ticket information.
TicketSystem: Handles the core logic for booking, canceling, and printing tickets.
TicketBooking: Provides the user interface to interact with the system
